# Collapse Audit Template

Use this template to run a structured, neutral analysis of any system.  
Focus on *structure and incentives*, not personalities.

---

## 1. System Snapshot

- **System Type:** (e.g. marketplace, publisher, public-sector agency)
- **Scale:** (users / staff / revenue ballpark)
- **Stated Strategy:** (how it says it works)
- **Observed Behavior:** (how it actually behaves)
- **Key Stakeholders:** (internal + external)

---

## 2. Dimension Scan

For each dimension, briefly describe the current state and assign a rough risk level.

### 2.1 Scale–Strategy Fit
- Notes:
- Risk Level (Low / Medium / High):

### 2.2 Incentive Coherence
- Notes:
- Risk Level:

### 2.3 Operational Transparency
- Notes:
- Risk Level:

### 2.4 Information Integrity
- Notes:
- Risk Level:

### 2.5 Governance Chain Strength
- Notes:
- Risk Level:

### 2.6 Mutation Pressure (Stress)
- Notes:
- Risk Level:

## 3. Archetype Mapping

Which structural archetypes are present?

- [ ] Gluttonous Factory  
- [ ] Factory–Boutique Paradox  
- [ ] Cheat Cartel  
- [ ] Rogue Savior (Bypass)  
- [ ] Other / Emerging (describe):

Notes:

## 4. Failure Mode Identification

List the main failure modes visible in this system.  
For each, add a brief description and evidence.

- Failure Mode 1:
  - Description:
  - Evidence:
- Failure Mode 2:
  - Description:
  - Evidence:
- Failure Mode 3:
  - Description:
  - Evidence:

---

## 5. Failure Chain (Narrative)

Describe the chain of events in structural terms:

1. **Initial Conditions:** (what was true before things started breaking)
2. **Trigger Events:** (what stressors hit the system)
3. **Amplifiers:** (what made things worse)
4. **Collapse Moment(s):** (where the system visibly failed)
5. **Aftermath:** (how the system stabilized or degraded)

---

## 6. Early Warning Indicators

What weak signals could have predicted this collapse?

- Indicator 1:
- Indicator 2:
- Indicator 3:

Which metrics, logs, or observations could have caught these earlier?

---

## 7. Structural Health Score (SHS)

Give a qualitative or numeric score for overall structural health, based on the dimensions and failure modes.

- **Current SHS:**  
- **Trajectory:** (Improving / Stable / Declining)
- **Key Justifications:**

---

## 8. Recommended Stabilization Moves

List **concrete, structural** interventions (not just “work harder” or “communicate more”).

- Change in incentives:
- Governance adjustments:
- Data / reporting fixes:
- Process or protocol changes:
- Sunset or sandbox high-risk experiments:
