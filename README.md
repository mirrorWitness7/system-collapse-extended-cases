# System Collapse Taxonomy

A neutral, research-oriented framework for analyzing **structural failure** in organizations, platforms, and socio-technical systems.

This repository focuses on **how systems fail**, not on personalities, blame, or event-driven narratives.  
It is designed for operators, analysts, and researchers who need a shared language for diagnosing collapse patterns across domains.

---

## Purpose

This framework is designed to:

- Map **dimensions** of structural health  
- Define reusable **archetypes** of collapse  
- Catalog recurring **failure modes**  
- Provide a practical **collapse audit template**  
- Demonstrate the framework using **anonymized and fictional case studies**

The emphasis is on *structure over story*.

🔧 *Clarification added below*

This framework is intentionally **domain-agnostic**.  
While many examples apply to technology and AI-enabled systems, the taxonomy is designed to generalize across industries where incentives, scale, and governance interact.

## Repository Structure

### `taxonomy/`
Core conceptual layers of the framework.

- `00_dimensions.md`  
  Core dimensions for assessing structural health (scale, incentives, governance, signal integrity, etc.)

- `01_archetypes.md`  
  Reusable structural archetypes of collapse that recur across domains

- `02_failure_modes.md`  
  Common failure mechanisms observed in collapsing systems

---

### `templates/`
Reusable tooling for applying the framework.

- `collapse_audit_template.md`  
  A practical template for running a structural collapse audit on any system

---

### `cases/`
Anonymized and fictional case studies demonstrating how the taxonomy applies in practice.

Cases span multiple domains, including publishing, platforms, public-sector systems, automation-heavy organizations, and AI-enabled products.

- `case_factory_boutique_publisher.md`  
  *An anonymized publisher case illustrating scale–strategy mismatch and metrics cannibalization.*

- `case_hollow_marketplace_platform.md`  
  *An anonymized two-sided platform case illustrating hollow liquidity and incentive misalignment.*

- `case_chain_of_command_overreach.md`  
  *A fictional public-sector case illustrating impedance mismatch between formal authority and external intervention.*

- `case_elite_performer_automation_fallacy.md`  
  *An anonymized case illustrating domain transfer failure, automation illusion, and risk externalization in open probabilistic systems.*

- `case_proxy_moral_escalation_procedural_system.md`  
  *An anonymized case illustrating proxy advocacy, scope inflation, and asymmetric risk transfer in procedural systems.*

- `case_margin_inversion_wrapper_platform.md`  
  *A fictionalized platform case illustrating margin erosion caused by usage-coupled cost structures and misclassified scalability.*

---

## Case Design Principles

All cases in this repository are:

- **Pattern-based**, not event-based  
- **Fully anonymized or fictionalized**  
- Written to be **globally applicable**  
- Focused on **structural dynamics**, not intent or morality  

Cases are **additive**: new cases do not redefine the taxonomy — they instantiate it.

---

## Intended Use

This framework is suitable for:

- Organizational and platform audits  
- Governance and risk analysis  
- Post-incident or post-collapse diagnostics  
- Socio-technical system analysis  
- AI and automation lifecycle failure analysis  

It is **not** intended for:
- Real-time incident response  
- Legal adjudication  
- Attribution of personal fault  

---

## Status

This repository is intentionally stable.  
The taxonomy evolves slowly; cases accumulate as evidence.

Structure first. Evidence second. Narrative last.
