# System Collapse Taxonomy

A neutral, research-oriented framework for analyzing structural failure in organizations and platforms.

This repo is designed to:
- Map **dimensions** of structural health
- Define reusable **archetypes** of collapse
- Catalog common **failure modes**
- Provide a practical **collapse audit template**
- Demonstrate the framework with **anonymized & fictional cases**

The goal is to help anyone working with systems — operations, governance, or risk — reason about *structure*, not gossip or personalities.

## Folder Structure

- `taxonomy/`
  - `00_dimensions.md` – core dimensions for assessing structural health
  - `01_archetypes.md` – recurring structural archetypes of collapse
  - `02_failure_modes.md` – catalog of failure modes across systems
- `templates/`
  - `collapse_audit_template.md` – reusable template for structural audits
- `cases/`
  - `case_factory_boutique_publisher.md` – anonymized publisher case
  - `case_hollow_marketplace_platform.md` – anonymized marketplace case
  - `case_chain_of_command_overreach.md` – fictional public-sector case

All cases are pattern-based and **fully anonymized or fictional**. They are written to be globally applicable and safe for public discussion.
