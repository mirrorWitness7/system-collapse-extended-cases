## Abstract

This case examines a fictionalized AI-enabled platform that positioned itself as a scalable software product while retaining a cost structure tightly coupled to usage. Despite visible revenue growth and market traction, the system experienced progressive gross margin erosion and increasing operational fragility. The collapse was driven not by demand failure, but by a structural mismatch between pricing, cost dynamics, and governance constraints.

## Structural Conditions

The system exhibited the following structural characteristics:

- Revenue derived primarily from usage-based fees passed through to third-party infrastructure providers
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) scaled linearly or superlinearly with customer activity
- Pricing decisions driven by competitive narrative rather than cost recovery
- Absence of enforced usage caps, throttles, or kill-switch mechanisms
- Internal classification of the product as a “platform” despite minimal decoupling between revenue and operational cost

---

## Failure Sequence

1. Initial adoption driven by novelty and low perceived friction
2. Acceptable margins observed at low volume
3. Customer usage increased faster than pricing discipline
4. COGS rose in proportion to, or faster than, revenue
5. Gross margin erosion masked by top-line growth and aggregate metrics
6. Increased reliance on external capital to sustain operations
7. Pressure to scale further intensified cost exposure rather than relieving it

## Diagnostic Signals

Early warning indicators included:

- Divergence between revenue growth and gross margin trends
- Increasing opacity within the Cost of Sales line item
- Lack of per-customer or per-usage profitability visibility
- Emphasis on “platform” identity without corresponding cost decoupling
- Absence of explicit stop conditions tied to unit economics

---

## Structural Interpretation

The failure was not caused by market rejection or insufficient demand.  
It emerged from a misclassification of the system’s economic nature.

The platform functioned as a reseller or orchestrator of external services while assuming the economics of a leveraged software product. This mismatch resulted in a system where growth amplified risk rather than absorbing it.

## Taxonomy Mapping

- **Archetype:** Hollow Platform
- **Failure Modes:** Metric Cannibalization, Cost Externalization
- **Dimensions:** Scale, Incentives, Signal Integrity

## Notes

This case is pattern-based and anonymized.  
The structural dynamics described are observable across multiple domains where usage-based costs are misaligned with pricing authority.

The sequence does not depend on specific technologies or vendors.
