# Failure Modes Catalog

This document lists common structural failure modes that appear across systems.  
Each failure mode can be tagged to one or more cases.

---

## 1. Scale–Strategy Mismatch

Growth outpaces the clarity of strategy. The system continues scaling tactics that no longer match its environment or positioning.

---

## 2. Incentive–Behavior Gap

Official values and KPIs reward different behaviors than the system claims to want. People choose incentives over slogans.

---

## 3. Governance Abandonment

Formal governance channels exist but are silently bypassed when they become inconvenient or politically risky.

---

## 4. Data / Reporting Corruption

Numbers are selectively defined, edited, or presented to support a preferred story rather than to reflect reality.

---

## 5. Metrics Cannibalization

One metric is optimized so aggressively that it destroys the meaning of related metrics (e.g. quantity vs quality, speed vs safety).

---

## 6. Staff–System Inversion

The people closest to reality (frontline staff, operators, moderators) have the least power to change the system, while those furthest away make the biggest decisions with the weakest data.

---

## 7. Outsider Capture

External partners, platforms, or “power users” gain disproportionate influence, steering the system away from its original design.

---

## 8. Impedance Mismatch (Protocol vs Urgency)

High-frequency, emotionally driven actors collide with low-frequency, protocol-bound actors. Each interprets the other as “broken.”

---

## 9. Operational Interference

An external actor attempts to “help” but unintentionally blocks or fragments a critical operational flow (e.g. supply chain, support queue, escalation path).

---

## 10. Perception Collapse

The narrative about the system collapses faster than the system itself. Trust erodes due to optics long before operations actually fail.

---

## 11. Shadow Governance Loop

Unofficial channels (backdoor chats, influencers, informal leaders) become the real decision locus, while formal governance is reduced to theater.
