# Collapse Archetypes

These archetypes describe recurring structural patterns that show up across industries.  
A single system can exhibit multiple archetypes at once.

---

## 1. Gluttonous Factory

**Pattern:**  
The system optimizes for throughput above all else. Governance, quality control, and human limits are treated as obstacles to be “worked around.”

**Traits:**
- Aggressive volume targets
- Underpowered quality or ethics functions
- “Do more with less” as permanent operating mode

**Typical Failure:**
- Burnout, quality collapse, regulatory shock, or public scandal triggered by one visible failure that was structurally inevitable.

## 2. Factory–Boutique Paradox

**Pattern:**  
The system tries to be both a high-volume factory and a high-touch boutique at the same time.

**Traits:**
- Mixed messaging: “premium” and “mass” at once
- Staff held to boutique standards with factory workloads
- Confused customers, confused employees, confused metrics

**Typical Failure:**
- Either the boutique side becomes fake (just marketing), or the factory side stalls under unrealistic quality promises.

## 3. Cheat Cartel

**Pattern:**  
The system’s incentives quietly reward bending or breaking rules. Cheating becomes normalized and eventually expected.

**Traits:**
- “Everyone does it” mentality
- People who follow the rules are punished via lower performance
- Leadership benefits from outcomes but disowns responsibility

**Typical Failure:**
- External investigation, internal revolt, or sudden collapse of trust when one incident reveals the normalized cheating.

## 4. Rogue Savior (The Bypass)

**Pattern:**  
An external (or semi-external) actor gains influence by solving a real problem faster than the core system can—but in doing so, bypasses critical safety, legal, or governance protocols.

**Traits:**
- High public visibility, emotionally framed “rescue”
- Operates on cash, speed, and narrative rather than process
- Treats bureaucracy as the enemy instead of integration challenge

**Typical Failure:**
- Short-term win followed by scandal, legal friction, or logistics chaos.  
  The “savior” crashes, but the core system is left with reputational damage and a mess to clean up.
