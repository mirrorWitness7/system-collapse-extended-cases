# Structural Dimensions

These six dimensions are used to assess the structural health and collapse pressure of any system (company, platform, institution, or hybrid).

Each dimension can be scored qualitatively (Low / Medium / High risk) or numerically (e.g. 1–5).

## 1. Scale–Strategy Fit

**Question:**  
Does the current scale of the system still match the strategy it was built on?

**Healthy Pattern:**
- Strategy explicitly updated as scale increases
- Clear trade-offs between growth, quality, and risk
- New segments or products don’t silently contradict the original model

**Failure Signals:**
- Strategy slides into “do everything for everyone”
- Growth targets override core positioning
- Leadership language is vague and aspirational while operations are chaotic

## 2. Incentive Coherence

**Question:**  
Do incentives reliably produce the behaviors the system claims to want?

**Healthy Pattern:**
- KPIs align with long-term outcomes
- People are not punished for raising risks or saying “no”
- Short-term rewards do not undermine structural integrity

**Failure Signals:**
- “Success” is defined purely by volume (emails, tickets, sales) regardless of quality
- People are rewarded for gaming metrics
- Whistleblowers, risk reports, or quality concerns are quietly penalized

## 3. Operational Transparency

**Question:**  
Can decision-makers see what is actually happening inside the system?

**Healthy Pattern:**
- Dashboards, logs, and reports are grounded in reality
- On-the-ground feedback flows upward without distortion
- Leaders periodically validate metrics against raw reality

**Failure Signals:**
- Leaders rely on sanitized reports
- Middle layers filter out bad news
- Discrepancies between “what the dashboard says” and “what operators experience daily”

## 4. Information Integrity

**Question:**  
Can the system trust its own information?

**Healthy Pattern:**
- Clear ownership of data pipelines
- Definitions for key metrics are stable and documented
- Retroactive edits or “number massaging” are rare and investigated

**Failure Signals:**
- Metrics get redefined mid-quarter to hit targets
- Backdating, reclassification, or selective counting are normal
- Important decisions rely on numbers nobody fully understands

---

## 5. Governance Chain Strength

**Question:**  
Who can say “stop” — and does that voice still matter?

**Healthy Pattern:**
- Clear lines of authority and accountability
- Escalation paths that work under stress
- Governance bodies with real power, not ceremonial roles

**Failure Signals:**
- Decisions made via backchannel rather than formal review
- Governance roles exist on paper but are ignored in practice
- Critical risks accepted without documentation or clear owner

---

## 6. Mutation Pressure (Stress)

**Question:**  
What forces are currently trying to mutate the system away from its design?

Examples: new markets, sudden regulation, aggressive competitors, technological shifts, social media pressure, or internal politics.

**Healthy Pattern:**
- Mutations are acknowledged and mapped
- Experiments are sandboxed instead of rewriting the whole system at once
- Leadership can articulate what must *not* change

**Failure Signals:**
- Constant “pivots” with no integration plan
- Crisis-driven decision-making
- Core processes rewritten hurriedly to satisfy loud external pressure
